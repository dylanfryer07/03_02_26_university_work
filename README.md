## Cleaning the data

### cleaning.py
We have counted how populated each column is using the pandas library

We have dropped the column starting with 4b1 due to it having 84% of its values blank

We have decided to fix dates in the date of survey column so that they are all of the same format

We are removing any rows that have 4 or more blank values

## visualisations.py
We have created separate histograms for the age, education level, region and gender of the respondance. This was written in python using plotly express and pandas
